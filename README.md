# Social-Service-Field-Word
As part of the PGDM curriculum at Xavier Institute of Social Service (XISS), Ranchi, I undertook a structured fieldwork module focused on community engagement and social development. This experience provided real-world exposure to grassroots issues and strengthened my understanding of sustainable development practices.
